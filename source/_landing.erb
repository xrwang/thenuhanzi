        <p>Hanzi (汉子), or "Han words" are the Chinese language system of writing, where each character is a word</p>

        <p>In recent years, automated moderation of politically sensitive content and censorship online has been increasing. In response, users have been creatively bypassing such automation by using homophones, memes and images, as well as occasionally creating their own new characters.</p>

        <p>Hanzimaker allows you to create new words using Chinese radicals — the building blocks of Chinese characters. Each radical has a meaning, and put together creatively with other radicals, can form a new character. It's as if each new word is a poem.</p>

        <p>If you have no prior knowledge about Hanzi, we recommend you to go through the Hanzi 101 session.</p>

        <p>The data generated during your participation will not be stored. You can download your newly built characters as images. </p>
