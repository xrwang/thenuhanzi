Dear $name,

We are so excited you are joining the Content Curation Engineering team at The Future of Memory, with the official title of Product Manager. Our founder, Riley Singh started The Future of Memory after he graduated from Stanford, in hopes of bringing people across the world closer together. The Future of Memory is more than just a social media company: we connect over 2.5 billion users across the world into one of the largest networks on Earth. People from anywhere in the world can build communities through shared interests, events, photos and posts.

Our name comes from Riley&#39;s dream of the internet as the future of memory, storing the moments and information that stitch together our common humanity.

As part of the CCE team, one of your biggest priorities is to support the Community and Public Policy (CPP) team in the decisions they make around content curation. Your team ensures that the policy decisions made by the CPP team are translated on the ground, to the 500 million posts per day, created by our users all throughout the world.

Your team is directly responsible for making the internet a better, safer place, and plays a crucial role within the Future of Memory. Your team makes sure our users are happy, entertained and delighted, receiving the information and content that appeals to them, balancing product direction with user needs. In addition to supporting the Policy team, your team also provides tooling for our incredible staff of content moderators.

Staying connected is at the core of The Future of Memory. We believe that when you allow everyone to have a voice, and you give everyone the power to speak, the world ends up in a better, more understanding place. The Future of Memory is the social infrastructure that allows everyone in the world to participate on equal terms — in their families, communities and politics.

The CCE team ensures that all content follows the guidelines set by the CPP team. Note that we are the Content Curation &lt;b&gt;Engineering&lt;/b&gt; team. As a result, we&#39;re always trying to find ways to optimize content curation.

We&#39;re so excited you&#39;ll be joining us to help build and scale curation in new ways, helping build the most cutting edge tools the world has ever seen. It&#39;s no small challenge to build a global space for conversation, at a time when the world needs it more than ever.

We&#39;re thrilled you&#39;ll be joining us.

Attached is your handbook and your 30-60-90 plan. You&#39;ll be interfacing with Jenna from the CPP team, and reporting to Roy, VP of product. Devon is the technical lead on your team. Your onboarding point of contact is Katie, in case you have any questions about company culture.

Welcome to The Future of Memory!

Patti de Mateo
Chief Product Officer at The Future of Memory

Hey $name! It’s time to get started on the User Relationship and Content Moderation Annual report!

Please work with Jenna and Devon to finish outlining:
	- The impact of content moderation on user growth, acquisition and retention
		- Do our users stay with us, even though they know their content is being moderated?
		- Does being known as a company that does content moderation help with user growth and acquisition? How does it hurt or hinder relationships with advertisers and users?
	- The impact of content moderation on user engagement
		- Do users notice content moderation?
		- Can we maximize user engagement using content moderation?
		- Does content moderation of sensitive topics affect overall user engagement?
	- The impact of content moderation on average user lifetime value
		- Does content moderation affect the number of ads a user sees?


Thanks!

Hi $name! Great work on the 2020 User Impact and Moderation Report. The VPs really loved it and it helped clarify some of the goals WRT profits this quarter.

I wanted to bring your attention to a scale situation that&#39;s coming up. We&#39;ve gotten a huge surge of users over the past two quarters, and we&#39;re trying to figure out where to put engineering resources this next quarter. We have two options.

The first option: work on the moderation tool that our content moderators are already using. As you know, content moderators receive potentially sensitive posts into this tool. There’s a “feed” where they go through and manually mark posts as “sensitive” or “not sensitive”. Upgrading the moderation tool would include things like one click word and image blurring in posts. We would also address usability and user interface issues, to speed up the content moderation process. Right now the content moderators are facing a really big backlog of content, though. If we go with option one, we could hire some additional moderators, but might have to contract out more.

The second option: Put engineering resources towards cutting edge automated moderation. We&#39;d like to invest in some of the latest machine learning technologies. We&#39;d start off with keyword filtering, just tackling automated moderation on text posts and then eventually expand to images. Riley is particularly excited about this, because it&#39;s also a way for us to get a patent under our belt. There’s a couple of other companies, like Facebook TK that already have patents out for automated filtering, so it’ll keep us really competitive. We&#39;re not going to delete posts that violate sensitive words as defined by the policy team, but we&#39;re going to float posts with sensitive keywords to the bottom.

How does that sound? What do you think we should do?

&lt;div class =&quot;github-ticket&quot;&gt;
$name and Devon’s checklist for automated content moderation milestone 1

- Use existing content moderation decisions by human content moderators as training data for machine learning model, to examine context of a sensitive word
- Use “sensitive topics” list from the Community and Public Policy team to generate other words related to the topics that might also indicate that a post is sensitive.
- Validate and test content moderation model for 1 month. We’re calling this content moderation model RoboSuperCM.
- Unleash RoboSuperCM in the world
- We’ll sink posts identified as “sensitive” to the bottom of peoples’ feeds, and we’ll float non-sensitive posts to the top.
- By next quarter, RoboSuperCM will allow us to re-organize the content moderation team, to use less human moderators.
&lt;/div&gt;

You, Devon and the engineering team work away, steadily. Weekly meetings via Zoom, one on ones with Jenna. You take breaks, walking up Twin Peaks by yourself, stopping by the community garden down the street. Sometimes you swing by The Ruby, to get a bottle of wine. When evening falls, you text a few of your friends back in New York. Jess and her girlfriend are now engaged. You think to yourself: I guess the pandemic makes people realize that life is short.

At the next all hands, would you mind pre-recording a little video of yourself telling us about RoboSuperCM? I think everyone across the company will love it and it’ll be a chance for everyone to recognize you.
Also, I know it’s not the end of the quarter yet, but just to let you know, Riley and Roy are really psyched about your performance. Be on the lookout ;)
Congrats on your FIRST BIG WIN!!!

Roy reaches out to you directly and tells you to take a few days off. “You’ve been working so hard, you deserve a break”, he says. And you don’t even have to file it as vacation days 😉, he says.

You head to the beach, to see the big blue Pacific. At the nearby coffee shop, you grab a latte. You flip through your Bumble app, catching up on messages. Maybe you’ll even meet someone this weekend.

Ads and stories from news outlets occasionally fill your screen. It’s cool to see the new features of RoboSuperCM in action. The top of your feed is filled with happy stories. Stock markets are up. They’re close to finding a COVID vaccine. Scientists are working hard. As you continue scrolling, you start to see some other news articles, posted by friends. All the way at the bottom, you see your friend Laurie, who always posts political stuff, usually US politics related. Except this time, Laurie is posting about an unfolding situations in Myanmar and Thailand. You don’t really know why Laurie’s post is all the way at the bottom. Maybe its sensitive content. But its fine, you shrug to yourself. RoboSuperCM as a machine learning model is designed to learn, and the more training data it has, the better it will become.

And besides, anything topic word flagged as sensitive by the Community and Public Policy team is definitely going to be floated to the bottom. The team knows what they are doing and you don’t need to question how they’re doing their jobs.

You head home, go to sleep.

Things are heating up on FOM... there’s some users who are somehow sending secret messages to each other in The Future of Memory. They’ve figured out that their posts contain sensitive words and that we send sensitive posts to the bottom. The users are bypassing our system by using all kinds of symbols, “Martian language” which they made by shifting character encoding, even new phrases they have made up, slang, and flipping text upside down to bypass the optical character recognition in images...making words look senseless to the algorithm. They’re also hacking the algorithm, having the same senseless phrase repeat across posts, and those posts get pushed to the top for &quot;trending&quot;.

We have two options, I think.

Option A: Have human moderators monitor the situation, flagging any posts with encoded words. You can Devon can build tools that help the moderators decipher and examine the encoded words manually.

Option B: Incorporate text matching into RoboSuperCM&#39;s machine learning model. You and Devon can take sensitive words and topics from the policy team, have your engineers transform those words and topics in “Martian language” and other variations. You could then train RoboSuperCM to examine the text.

What do you think?

You send Jenna and Roy the milestones:

$name and Devon’s proposed engineering milestones for better content moderator tools:


- Fix bugs and UI
	Currently, a number of bugs are part of our internal content moderation software, as you can see in the screenshot. Sometimes videos freeze up the software, other times the video doesn’t embed correctly and content moderators have to manually visit linked videos.
- Implement onboarding sequence and practice sessions for contractor content moderators
	Currently, our content moderation tool requires a lot of onboarding and training.
- Implement a new feature where all images and videos are blurred and include a content warning.
- Posts with sensitive keywords are currently sent to moderators in this UI. Make sure this process is faster

It’s better for the long run. You can’t always have people going through things manually. After all, optimization is the key to building a good tech company (TK). And you’re a tech company, not a human resource management company. There’s a reason why The Future of Memory is a globally known social media network located in Silicon Valley, and not just another “data servicing” company in the Phillipines. It’s a hard decision and some moderators will have to find another job, now that FOM will need them less, but that&#39;s the way of the world.

$name! How’s it going over there? Things are pretty quiet in Redwood City. Trying to stay healthy, I&#39;m trying to staying sane with all the kids at home, doing online school...

Anyways, just letting you know that RoboSuperCM is doing a fine job, but we’re encountering some new issues. We’re wondering if you and Devon can improve upon the ML model?

We’re seeing a large number of memes come through. You know, memes, images, text in images. I don’t know if there’s cool new computer vision stuff that you guys can implement into RoboSuperCM?

The other solution would be to contract out more human moderators. That could be a permanent or stopgap solution, and the upside is we’re giving people jobs and ensuring some things don’t get deleted. What do you think?

Oh, finally, the Community and Public Policy over here would like to start to slowly delete any sensitive posts instead of just floating them to the bottom. It’s a headache and data liability for us to store all of them. We don’t want to get subpoenaed, you know 😉. It’s hard being literally the future of memory...

Tangential update on our company data retention policies: Riley went on a vacation to Bali for a few weeks, just to escape everything going on here with the pandemic and all (I know, sounds nice, right?) and he had this vision. The Future of Memory is not only home and a place for everyones’ memories, but it’s also the history of humanity, the history that we want our children to remember. Which is why we have to be careful of what we present to the next generation.

Oh, and a heads up that the Community and Pub Policy team over here is starting to think about the upcoming election. We’re trying to balance the needs of our advertisers and users alongside some disinformation models. It’s a sticky situation, we’re getting flak from both sides of the aisle in DC, but nothing you and Devon need to worry about yet. Our counsels are doing a great job.

Anyways. What do you think about new features in RoboSuperCM? Should we update the model? Or should we just hire more contractors?
&lt;/div&gt;

You recall what Riley said at the most recent all hands. “We’re shifting our company to be focused on strategic opportunism…We’re a tech company, we’re here to build and make software, we recognize that people can change the world for the better, if they have the best tools and algorithms on their side.”
And you want to keep building those tools and algorithms to help people.
You and Devon spec out some of the engineering milestones for implementing text recognition and object recognition in images. The team also files a patent for the object recognition system.

We just need to get out of here for a bit, you know? Cabin fever.
Before I head off, was wondering if you and Devon could ship a feature out on RoboSuperCM? We’ve noticed users making an entirely new language to “hack” RoboSuperCM. The Community and Public Policy team has flagged a lot of these words as sensitive. It’s not great for the community, you know?
A lot of these posts are sensitive, have topics that might be too extreme for the community. Plus with everything going on, our advertisers are pretty stressed and want to make sure their ads are reaching the communities they need. It becomes impossible when we have this new made up language adding noise into our training data. Advertisers want to make sure their dollars per click make sense, that ads are being served to a stable social network ecosystem. What do you think? Do you have time?

Hope you&#39;re doing well in these unprecedented times.

	As you know, innovation is in our blood at The Future of Memory. We have to say, we’re a bit disappointed with your recent product decision to focus engineering resources on more manual work rather than automating moderation. We see this as a huge learning gap in the onboarding process. We accept that this was not your fault; it was our failure to encourage a spirit of risk taking and technical innovation.

	Due to your decision making, we have had to increase the number of moderation contractors. It’s costing us a lot more money. Quite honestly, we’re a technology company, not a human resources company. Riley feels like with the increased number of contractors and the mangers needed for them, we’re almost like a click farm or temp agency. Many of these new contractors. are unable to keep up at the pace we need them to. This is a huge bottleneck, and additionally the policy team has to constantly debrief with moderation managers, so that context of the posts are understood. Our advertisers are unhappy that the number of ad views promised to them are falling short. Other, rival media companies are filing multiple patents this quarter. Shareholders are unhappy.

	We value you enormously as an employee and would like to offer you the option of a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). During this time, we’ll suggest you watch some of these videos below, read some of the articles and try to understand where we come from in our technical solution based approach to mediating global conversation.

	After looking at this material, we know that we will be closely assessing your performance on your next assigned project.

Thank you for your hard work,
Roy

Little things start to pile up. All the perks that felt exciting to you in the beginning now feel a little weird. It’s lonely working at home. It’s hard to stay motivated, trying to please Riley and the VPs, when you&#39;ve never met any of these people. Everyone is just a floating head on your video screen.

You get a Nintendo Switch and start playing games. The only thing you really look forward to is Legend of Zelda after work. What’s the point of anything? It feels like there’s really no future. You moved out here to meet new people, but because of the pandemic, everyone is inside.

You work with Devon to scope out tickets for the engineers, keeping Jenna and Roy updated. The Future of Memory has taken over every minute of your waking hours, even your sleeping hours. Some mornings, you wake up after an anxious nightmare, that you have let Jenna and Roy down, or that Devon secretly thinks you don’t have enough technical knowledge to be a product manager. Or even worse, that Riley is disappointed with you and you no longer can send your mom money every month.

Maybe it’s tiredness, but you start to feel burnt out. The loneliness is getting to you — when you read the news and look outside, things feel pretty bleak for the rest of the world. At home, you drink every night, you order takeout from Caviar, things seem pretty okay. But it’s like your brain is drained of dopamine. No matter how hard you try, it feels like the adrenaline that kept you going no longer works.

You have lunch with an old college friend, Kelvin, in Dolores Park. When you see Kelvin, you remember how naive you were in college, how hopeful. How you and Kelvin both wanted to make a difference out in the world. Kevin’s from the Bay Area and currently working as a middle school information science teacher in Oakland public schools, living out of his parents garage in San Francisco. You feel like a sell out when you talk to Kelvin. “But that’s stupid”, you say to yourself. “I’m taking care of my family with what I’m making at FOM.”

The “radical” or “sensitive” keywords were never directly told to you — the Community and Pub Policy team always directly fed those words into the system. Some journalist manages to get a copy of the sensitive words and what you read shocks you.

Some people at work try to organize, try to sign a letter telling Riley to step up, to take a stronger ethical stance, given that The Future of Memory has the memories of the world and the future of the world in its hands. Everyone signs the letter, presenting it at the most recent all-hands. You sign the letter too. Riley doesn’t respond.

He thinks he just has a cold from working at the cafe but he can’t go back in until he gets negative result. I think I am ok, your aunt posted about this zinc pill that prevents covid on FOM and I have been taking that. Ok love you have a good day.


[[Put down your phone -&gt;B]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="B" tags="" position="3050,2700" size="100,100">You try to continue working but can’t concentrate. You go for a walk down your street, to the community garden near your house. It’s located on top of a hill. This morning, the houses are obscured by a mix of fog and smoke from wildfires nearby.

[[Look out into the smog -&gt;C]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="C" tags="" position="3025,2850" size="100,100">The world is literally burning. Your feel a weight on your shoulders, a pile of contradictions. You feel crazed, boxed in. This morning, reports and messages flooded your your inbox. Slack messages piled up from co-workers with negative press about The Future of Memory’s newsfeed algorithm and community policies. Dissent from Hong Kong and China being stifled on FOM. Censorship in Belarus after Riley’s directives to the Policy team, white nationalists in the US being amplified because of the algorithm. You realize that all along you had no real transparency into anything at work.

The last job you had was community management at an online marketplace, which was fine, but the work culture was really toxic. After long hours at the office, you would trudge home to your shared apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Your only roommate, Jess, would always be hanging at home with her girlfriend, so it was really like you had two roommates. It was nice most of the time, but it occasionally felt really lonely, especially watching Jess and her girlfriend be so lovey-dovey. Would you ever meet someone that you loved so much?

The cold New York winter came and went. One day, The Future of Memory, one of the world&#39;s biggest social media companies, recruited you directly. You jumped at the opportunity to move out to SF. You left New York at the end of February, and now you feel pretty lucky to be in California, in your own apartment as the pandemic seems to show no sign of abating.

As you look out into the thick fog you realize the future is not something distant from you, it is something you are part of shaping. Because you are here. All along you thought you were just a steward, a technician, someone who assists in saving and storing. But that was your fear talking.

Whether you like it or not, as a living being, you are in this world. And the future is made up of one thing — the actions of people, happening here and now. That includes you.

You take a deep breath. You know what you have to do.

[[End]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="D" tags="" position="3025,3000" size="100,100">You feel powerless. You wonder if The Future of Memory is doing all the good it says it is doing. You told yourself yesterday that if you weren’t here, working as a Product Manager, someone else would be. That you’re just doing your job. That there are good things that come out of FOM, that it connects people. There is no way to calculate a net positive or net good.

You think of your college friend Kelvin, and what he said about building new systems. That maybe the old systems no longer work and we need new ones. New ones that value people, not money.

Maybe you’re just scared, you think, because you’ve spent so much time building old systems, the old systems that rewarded you.

You wonder if the new hires are being treated well, and being treated fairly.

The hills are shrouded in fog. It&#39;s the second level of a two family home. This is the first time you&#39;ve ever managed to not have roommates and it&#39;s the best. The Future of Memory treats its employees really well, so you&#39;ve already gotten relocation costs covered (including your shiny new Casper bed) and a signing bonus, which you spent on gifts for your mom&#39;s birthday last week.
