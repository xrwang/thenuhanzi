We are so excited that you'll be joining the Content Curation Engineering team at The Future of Memory as Product Manager. Our founder, Riley Singh started The Future of Memory after he graduated from Stanford, in hopes of bringing people across the world closer together. The Future of Memory is more than just a social media company: we connect over 2.5 billion users across the world into one of the largest networks on Earth. People from anywhere in the world can build communities through shared interests, events, photos and posts. Our name comes from Riley's dream of the Internet as the future of memory, storing the moments and information that stitch together our common humanity. 

As part of the CCE team, one of our biggest priorities is to support the Community and Public Policy (CPP) team in the decisions they make around content curation. The CCE ensures that the policy decisions made by the CPP team are translated on the ground, to the 500 million posts per day, created by our users all throughout the world. The CCE team is directly responsible for not only making the internet a better, safer place, but plays a crucial role within the Future of Memory. The CCE team makes sure our users are happy, entertained and delighted, receiving the information and content that appeals to them, balancing product direction with user needs. 

Staying connected is at the core of The Future of Memory. We believe that when you allow everyone to have a voice, and you give everyone the power to speak, the world ends up in a better, more understanding place. The Future of Memory is the social infrastructure that allows everyone in the world to participate on equal terms â€” in their families, communities and politics.

Since the CCE team ensures that all content follows the guidelines set by the CPP team, we're always trying to find ways to optimize content curation. We're so excited you'll be joining us to help build and scale curation in new ways, helping build the most cutting edge tools. It's no small challenge to build a global space for conversation. We're thrilled you'll be joining us. 

Attached is your handbook and your 30-60-90 plan. You'll be interfacing with Jenna from the CPP team, and reporting to Roy, VP of product. Your onboarding point of contact is Katie, in case you have any questions about company culture.

Welcome to The Future of Memory!

Patti de Mateo
Chief Product Officer at The Future of Memory

Welcome to the company. Wondering if you want to grab a coffee some time? Excited to get to know you! A little about me: I've been counsel here for over 5 years, came here right after law school and haven't looked back sense. You'll have to talk to Michael, our Senior Counsel as well, he's great and can brain dump a bit on Riley's future oriented thinking. What's your cal like?

[[Intro-Slack-2&lt;-Another Slack Alert]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Intro-Slack-2" tags="" position="943,394" size="100,100">Hi $name! I'm Taylor from accounting. Let's do a virtual hang out soon. Is your calendar the most up to date? I am also a huge fan of my Vitamix -- I've been making a lot of nut butter in it. Look forward to chatting. 
[[Intro-Slack-3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Getting ready" tags="" position="450,375" size="100,100">It's your first day of work at The Future of Memory! You're feeling nervous and excited. It's a huge deal to have this job, you've worked hard at your previous company doing community management, and this new job is a big upgrade. 

You get out of your nice new Casper Bed with the Floyd bedframe and walk to the fridge. Inside the fridge are some fresh berries, oat milk and some granola. 

You look out your apartment window in Portrero Hill, San Francisco. The hills are shrouded in fog. It's the second level of a two family home. This is the first time you've ever managed to not have roommates and it's the best. The Future of Memory treats its employees really well, so you've already gotten relocation costs covered (including your shiny new Casper bed) and a signing bonus, which you spent on gifts for your Mom's birthday last week. 

It feels really good to be taken care of. The last job you had was community management at an online marketplace, which was fine, but the work culture was really toxic. After long hours at the office, you would trudge home to your shared apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Your only roommate, Jess, would always be hanging at home with her girlfriend, so it was really like you had two roommates. It was nice most of the time, but it felt really lonely sometimes, especially watching Jess and her girlfriend be so lovey-dovey. When the cold New York winter came, and The Future of Memory reached out to you directly, you jumped at the opportunity to move out to SF. It would be a fresh new start. Maybe you'd meet someone. Maybe you'd fall in love. Maybe you'd finally learn how to adult.

You stand in your living room, looking at the fog, the sweeping, large sky, the houses dotted along the hill and Sutro Tower blinking a lonely little light. This is a new life, here.

Your mom texts you.

[[Get on the bus]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Get on the bus" tags="" position="450,675" size="100,100">You head out to catch the bus, waiting with coworkers at the stop. It starts to rain 

[[Take a nap]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Take a nap" tags="" position="450,800" size="100,100">You drift off into sleep, with your Beatz headphones on, your new Allbirds sneakers feeling comfortable on your feet. 

When you wake up, you're in sunny South Bay. You get off, swipe into the office where Amanda shows you to your desk.

[[Dummy Challenge &lt;- First assignment]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="First Challenge" tags="" position="1098,820" size="100,100">Hi $name!!! Great work on the 2020 User Impact and Moderation Report. The VPs really loved it and it helped clarify some of the goals wrt profits this quarter. I added some comments and feedback on the document by the way. The marked up version is here.

Also, I wanted to bring your attention to a situation with scale that's coming up. We've gotten a huge surge of users last quarter and we're trying to figure out where to put engineering resources this quarter. We have two options.

The first: work on the moderation tool that our CMs are doing, like building in automatic word blurring, UI issues, things like that to speed up their process. Right now they're facing a really big backlog of content though. We could hire some additional moderators, but might have to contract out. 

The second option: Put engineering resources towards cutting edge automated moderation. We'd like to invest in some of the latest machine learning technologies. We'd start off with keyword filtering, just doing text posts and then eventually expand to images. Riley is particularly excited about this, because it's also a way for us to get a patent under our belt. We're not going to delete posts that violate sensitive words defined by the policy team, but start off with floating those posts to the bottom.

What do you think?

[[Challenge-1-OptA &lt;- Let's do option one, hire more moderators, improve the day to day]]
